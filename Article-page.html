                <div class="summary">
                    The American dream, some belive it, while others don't. But everyone has an idea of what it could
                    be. Let me explain, if you were to ask someone if the american dream is still alive and even if they
                    said no, they could still tell you what people think it is. They would mostly tell you that
                    it's the idea that
                    anyone in america has the reasouces to get to a dream that one might have. But one reason why they
                    may think that the american dream is not real may because they couldn't get to their dream. Which is
                    a whole other conversation. The reason why they may think that way is because they didn't try hard
                    enough and that sounds hard. But american's has a ton of reasouces that they can take advantage of,
                    that others around the world would be grateful to take advange of but
                    they don't for some reason and i am never going to change my mind of that though, unless my
                    dream(plan) doesn't happen. This is why sometimes when the topic of the
                        american dream comes up and i hear someone saying that its not true, then they start to talk
                        about how america is a bad place, i snap on them and unload everything I got on themon them because fun fact
                        about me i have autism and people said that i would never to be able to walk, speak, and do
                        anything by myself. But my foaster mother was a incredible person and put me into school and
                        made sure that i had a good education. Which ended up being great for me and aloud me to become
                        the person i am today. Now i am able to walk, speak, and be smarter then most in the classes i
                        take. Not trying to flex on anyone, just trying to show you how education helped me and you may
                        be think, what does education has to do with the american dream, i would say you that it just
                        shows you how ameria has reasouces that we can take advantage of because this may be hard to
                        belive but only around 45.96% of the people in the world have/are getting a education. Along
                        with
                        that their are people that in the United States of America that a spoiled when it comes to
                        having these reasouces because they think that everyone in every country has those reasouces. Which they need to realize Americans our lucky because this great country allows them to do things that other countries wouldn't let them or couldn't let them because they dod have the resources.
