            <div class="American-Dream-Summary">
                The American dream, some believe it, while others don't. But everyone has an idea of what it could be.
                But let’s explore why it’s like that, Some people may believe that the American dream is not real
                because they were unable to achieve their dream. But at the end of the day they know that it’s not
                compete gone because they see some people that were able to achieve their dreams. For instance i hear
                tons of people say that the american deam isn’t real but they normally have no good reason to be saying
                that, just beside the fact that they hear people saying that it doesn’t exist. I feel that most people
                believe that the american dream is being rich and having the high life. But one thing you need to get in
                your head is that the american dream is mainly the idea that any american can live in america in peace
                and achive a dream thats the given person is willing to work at to achive. For inatnce, my American
                dream is a big plan that i am working at right now. It’s me wanting to go to college for a computer
                science degree. Then me to work a big tech company like Google or Amazon. Then after that to maybe make
                my own company to make a good amount of money, that will might help me to become a senator for a state
                because i would love to have a state that would want me to repesente them in cogness and also because i
                find it funny how we get people to repersente us and then they end up not. But that’s just my thought.
                But i know that i am going to have to work hard, if i want a single one of those things to happen
                because life is not going to just hand you things.
