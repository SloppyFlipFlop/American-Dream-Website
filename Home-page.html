<!-- The america dream is depending on who you ask, is not alive. But for most people it is still alive, is that it a idea that if you work hard eough you will be able to achive what ever you want. For intance i 
    (Fernando Nevarez) want to become a software developer for a big company like google or amazon one day. But i am not going 
    to achive that dream by doing nothing, i am going to have to have to go to collage and get a degree in compter science or 
    something that will show that i know how to code.  -->

<!-- The american dream is a idea that if you try hard euogh you can achive whatever you what in america because of the
    reasouces what america's have -->
